# FP_402_Demo_Project

## Overview
This repository serves as a demonstration for the FP (Functional Programming) course at Amirkabir University of Technology. As a Teaching Assistant, I have created a simplified version of the course project to provide students with an example of how to implement certain functionalities.


## Project Description
The full project description for the course is available in the [Project Description](https://github.com/MahdiHaeri/FP_402_Demo_Project/blob/master/doc/FP%20Project%201402%20-%20v2.pdf) file. This demo project covers a specific part of the overall requirements, offering a practical example that students can refer to while working on their assignments.
